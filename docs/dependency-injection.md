The Joomla! Dependency Injection package provides a simple `container-interop` (upcoming `PSR-11`) compatible
Inversion of Control (IoC) Container for your application.

The Joomla! Dependency Injection Container supports

  - **factories** and **instances** (i.e., **closures**, **callables**, **objects**, **arrays**, and even **scalars**)
  - **shared** and **protected** modes
  - **caching** and **cloning** of resources according to the modes
  - enforcing **recreation** of resources
  - **aliases**
  - **scopes** using the **decorator** pattern for containers
  - **delegate lookup**
  - **object creation** on the fly to resolve dependencies
  - ability to **extend** resources
  - **service providers**

In this document,

  - **factory** is a callable or closure, that takes the container as argument and returns the resource instance;
  - **instance** is the resource instance, i.e., the return value of a factory, or an explicitly defined value (may be a scalar as well);
  - **resource** is a key/value pair, with the key being the id, and the value being a factory or an instance.

### Container Interoperability
    
The Joomla! Dependency Injection package implements the [PSR-11 proposal](https://github.com/container-interop/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/container.md)
for Dependency Injection Containers to achieve interoperability.
Until PSR-11 gets accepted, Joomla! DI uses the [`container-interop`](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop)
namespace.

### Creating a Container object

Creating a container usually happens very early in the application lifecycle.
It can be created even before the application is instantiated,
and provided to the application as an external dependency.
This allows your application access to the DI Container,
which you can then use within the app class to build your controllers and their dependencies.

```php
$container = (new Joomla\DI\Container)
    ->registerServiceProvider(new MyApp\Service\CoolProvider)
    ->registerServiceProvider(new MyApp\Other\CoolStuffProvider)
    ...
    ->registerServiceProvider(new MyApp\ApplicationProvider);
}

$app = $container->get('MyApp\\Application');
$app->execute();
```

### Hierachical Containers

#### Decorating other Containers

<!-- [x] Container can decorate an arbitrary Interop compatible container -->
If you have any other container implementing the `ContainerInterface`, you can pass it to the constructor.

```php
use \Joomla\DI\Container;

$container = new Container($arbitraryInteropContainer);
```

<!-- [x] Container can manage an alias for a resource from an arbitrary Interop compatible container -->
You'll then be able to access any resource from `$arbitraryInteropContainer` through `$container`, thus virtually adding 
the features (like aliasing) of the Joomla! DI Container to the other one.

#### Scopes

The decoration feature can be used to manage different resolution scopes.

```php
use Joomla\DI\Container;

$container = new Container;

$container->set('Some\Interface\I\NeedInterface', new My\App\InterfaceImplementation);

// Application executes... Come to a class that needs a different implementation.

$child = new Container($container);
$child->set('Some\Interface\I\NeedInterface', new My\Other\InterfaceImplementation);
```

This allows you to easily override an interface binding for a specific controller, without
destroying the resolution scope for the rest of the classes using the container.
<!-- [x] Child container has access to parent's resources -->
<!-- [x] Child container resolves parent's alias to parent's resource -->
A child container will search recursively through its parent containers to resolve all the required dependencies.
For this behaviour, a convenience method `createChild` is provided.

```php
use Joomla\DI\Container;

$container = new Container;

$container->set('Some\Interface\I\NeedInterface', new My\App\InterfaceImplementation);

// Application executes... Come to a class that needs a different implementation.

$child = $container
    ->createChild()
    ->set('Some\Interface\I\NeedInterface', new My\Other\InterfaceImplementation);
```

### Setting an Item

Setting an item within the container is very straightforward.
<!-- [x] Resources can be set up with Callables -->
<!-- [x] Resources can be set up with Closures -->
<!-- [x] Resources can be scalar values -->
You pass the `set` method a string `$key`
and a `$value`, which can be pretty much anything. If the `$value` is an anonymous function or a `Closure`,
or a callable value, that value will be set as the resolving callback for the `$key`.
If it is anything else (an instantiated object, array, integer, serialized controller, etc) it will be wrapped
in a closure and that closure will be set as the resolving callback for the `$key`.

<!-- [x] The callback gets the container instance as a parameter -->
> If the `$value` you are setting is a closure or a callable, it will receive a single function argument,
> the calling container. This allows access to the container within your resolving callback.

```php
use Joomla\DI\Container;

$container = new Container;

// Setting a scalar
$container->set('foo', 'bar');

// Setting an object
$container->set('something', new Something);

// Setting a callable
$container->set('callMe', array($this, 'callMe'));

// Setting a closure
$container->set(
    'baz',
    function (Container $c)
    {
        // some expensive $stuff;

        return $stuff;
    }
);
```

#### Resource Options

<!-- [x] 'shared' and 'protected' mode can be set independently -->
When setting items in the container, you can specify whether or not the item is supposed to be a
shared or protected item.

```php
use Joomla\DI\Container;

$container = new Container;

$shared = true;
$protected = true;

$container->set(
    'foo',
    function ()
    {
        // some expensive $stuff;

        return $stuff;
    },
    $shared,
    $protected
);
```

<!-- [x] Default mode is 'not shared' and 'not protected' -->
Default mode is 'not shared' and 'not protected'.

<!-- [x] Resources from an arbitrary Interop compatible container are 'shared' and 'protected' -->
If a container was passed to the constructor, which is not a `Joomla\DI\Container`, the resources
from that container are treated as 'shared' and 'protected'.

`Container` provides convenience methods for setting shared and protected resources.

##### Shared Resources

A shared item means that when you get an item from the container, the resolving
callback will be fired once, and the value will be stored and used on every subsequent request for that
item. You can set a shared resource using the `share` method.

```php
use Joomla\DI\Container;

$container = new Container;

$container->share(
    'foo',
    function ()
    {
        // some expensive $stuff;

        return $stuff;
    }
);
```

<!-- [x] The convenience method share() sets resources as shared, but not as protected by default -->
Resources set with `share` are not protected by default.
<!-- [x] The convenience method share() sets resources as protected when passed true as third arg -->
If you pass `true` as third argument, you can both share AND protect an item. A good use case for this would
be a database connection that you only want one of, and you don't want it to be overwritten.

You can check whether a resource is shared with the `isShared` method.

```php
var_dump($container->isShared('foo')); // prints bool(true) for the example above
```

##### Protected Resources

The other option, protected, is a special status that you can use to prevent others from overwriting
the item down the line. A good example for this would be a global config that you don't want to be
overwritten.
<!-- [x] Setting an existing protected resource throws an OutOfBoundsException -->
<!-- [x] Setting an existing non-protected resource replaces the resource -->

```php
use Joomla\DI\Container;

$container = new Container;

// Don't overwrite my db connection.
$container->protect(
    'bar',
    function (Container $c)
    {
        $config = $c->get('config');

        $databaseConfig = (array) $config->get('database');

        return new DatabaseDriver($databaseConfig);
    }
);
```

<!-- [x] The convenience method protect() sets resources as protected, but not as shared by default -->
Resources set with `protect` are not shared by default.
<!-- [x] The convenience method protect() sets resources as shared when passed true as third arg -->
If you pass `true` as third argument, you can both share AND protect an item.

You can check whether a resource is protected with the `isProtected` method.

```php
var_dump($container->isProtected('bar')); // prints bool(true) for the example above
```

### Item Aliases

Any item set in the container can be aliased. This allows you to create an object that is a named
dependency for object resolution, but also have a "shortcut" access to the item from the container.
<!-- [x] Both the original key and the alias return the same resource -->
You get the same resource with the alias as you would with the original key.

```php
use Joomla\DI\Container;

$container = new Container;

$container->set(
    'Really\Long\ConfigClassName',
    function ()
    {
        // ...snip
    }
);

$container->alias('config', 'Really\Long\ConfigClassName');

$container->get('config'); // Returns the value set on the aliased key.
```

### Getting an Item

At its most basic level, the DI Container is a registry that holds keys and values. When you set
an item on the container, you can retrieve it by passing the same `$key` to the `get` method that
you did when you set the method in the container.

> If you've aliased a set item, you can also retrieve it using the alias key.

```php
use Joomla\DI\Container;

$container = new Container;

$container->set('foo', 'bar');

$foo = $container->get('foo'); // $foo now contains 'bar'
```

Normally, the value you'll be passing will be a closure. When you fetch the item from the container,
the closure is executed, and the result is returned.

```php
use Joomla\DI\Container;

$container = new Container;

$container->set(
    'github',
    function ()
    {
        // Create an instance of \Joomla\Github\Github;

        return $github;
    }
);

$github = $container->get('github');

var_dump($github instanceof \Joomla\Github\Github); // prints bool(true)
```

<!-- [x] A new resource instance is returned for non-shared resources -->
If you get the item again, the closure is executed again and the result is returned.

```php
// Picking up from the previous code block

$github2 = $container->get('github');

var_dump($github2 === $github); // prints bool(false)
```

<!-- [x] The same resource instance is returned for shared resources -->
However, if you specify that the object as shared when setting it in the container, the closure will
only be executed once (the first time it is requested). The value will be stored and then returned
on every subsequent request.

```php
use Joomla\DI\Container;

$container = new Container;

$container->share(
    'twitter',
    function ()
    {
        // Create an instance of \Joomla\Twitter\Twitter;

        return $twitter;
    }
);

$twitter  = $container->get('twitter');
$twitter2 = $container->get('twitter');

var_dump($twitter === $twitter2); // prints bool(true)
```

<!-- [x] getNewInstance() will always return a new instance, even if the resource was set to be shared -->
If you've specified an item as shared, but you really need a new instance of it for some reason, you
can force the creation of a new instance by using the `getNewInstance` method.

> When you force create a new instance on a shared object, that new instance replaces the instance
> that is stored in the container and will be used on subsequent requests.

```php
// Picking up from the previous code block

$twitter3 = $container->getNewInstance('twitter');

var_dump($twitter === $twitter3); // prints bool(false)

$twitter4 = $container->get('twitter');
var_dump($twitter3 === $twitter4); // prints bool(true)
```

<!-- [x] Accessing an undefined resource throws an InvalidArgumentException -->
If you try to retrieve a resource for an undefined key, an `InvalidArgumentException` is thrown.
<!-- [x] The existence of a resource can be checked -->
To avoid that, the existence of a resource can be checked with the `has` method.
It returns `true`, if the container knows the key, and `false` otherwise.
<!-- [x] has() also resolves the alias if set. -->
Of course, `has` also resolves an alias (if set).

### Building Objects

<!-- [x] Building an object returns an instance of the requested class -->
The most powerful feature of setting an item in the container is the ability to bind an implementation
to an interface. This is useful when using the container to build your app objects. You can typehint
against an interface, and when the object gets built, the container will pass your implementation.

This gives you great flexibility to build your objects within the container.
If your model class requires a user repository, you can typehint against a `UserRepositoryInterface`
and then bind an implementation to that interface to be passed into the model when it is created.

```php
use Joomla\DI\Container;

class User implements UserRepositoryInterface
{
    // ...snip
}

class UserProfile
{
    /** @var UserRepositoryInterface The user (property should not be public in production code!) */
    public $user;

    public function __construct(UserRepositoryInterface $user)
    {
        $this->user = $user;
    }
}

$container = new Container;

// Tell the container, that we want `User` to fulfill the `UserRepositoryInterface` dependency
$container->set(
    'UserRepositoryInterface',
    function ()
    {
        return new User;
    }
);

// Create the `UserProfile` object. 
$userProfile = $container->buildObject('UserProfile');

var_dump($userProfile->user instanceof User); // prints bool(true)
var_dump($userProfile->user instanceof UserRepositoryInterface); // prints bool(true)
```

As the last example shows, the power lies in the container's ability to build complete objects, instantiating
any needed dependency along the way.

#### How it works

To do that, the container looks at the constructor of the class being instantiated.
It then tries to resolve the dependencies using the typehints.
<!-- [x] Dependencies are resolved from the container's known resources -->
If a typehint requires an interface, the dependency is resolved from the container's known resources.
<!-- [x] Resources are created, if they are not present in the container -->
Dependencies not known by the container are created, if possible, following the same rules as the current resource.
<!-- [x] Dependencies are resolved from their default values -->
Scalar arguments are provided with their default value.

#### When it does not work

<!-- [x] A DependencyResolutionException is thrown, if an object can not be built due to unspecified constructor parameter types -->
<!-- [x] A DependencyResolutionException is thrown, if an object can not be built due to dependency on unknown interfaces -->
The container can only resolve dependencies that have been properly typehinted or given a default value.
If the resource can not be built, a `DependencyResolutionException` is thrown.

<!-- [x] Attempting to build a non-class returns false -->
When you try to build a non-class, `buildObject` and `buildSharedObject` both return `false`. 

<!-- [x] When a circular dependency is detected, a DependencyResolutionException is thrown (Bug #4) -->
Sometimes circular dependencies are encountered. 

```php
use Joomla\DI\Container;

$container = new Container();

$fqcn = 'Extension\\vendor\\FooComponent\\FooComponent';
$data = array();

$container->set(
    $fqcn,
    function (Container $c) use ($fqcn, $data)
    {
        $instance = $c->buildObject($fqcn);
        $instance->setData($data);

        return $instance;
    }
);

$container->get($fqcn);
```

It is not possible for the container to resolve that, as it produces an endless loop.
However, `Container` detects that and throws a `DependencyResolutionException`.

#### Shared and non-shared Objects

<!-- [x] Building a non-shared object returns a new object whenever requested -->
When you build an object, it is stored as a known resource in the container with the class name as the key.
You can then `get` the item from the container by class name later on. Alias support applies here as well.

<!-- [x] Building a shared object returns the same object whenever requested -->
You can also specify to build a shared object by using the function `buildSharedObject($key)`. This
works exactly as you would expect. The instantiated object is cached and returned on subsequent requests.

### Extending an Item

The Container also allows you to extend items. Extending an item can be thought of as a way to
implement the decorator pattern, although it's not really in the strict sense.
When you `extend` an item, you must pass the key for the item you want to extend, and then a closure as the second
argument.
The closure will receive 2 arguments.
The first is result of the callable for the given key,
and the second will be the container itself.
<!-- [x] An extended resource replaces the original resource -->
When extending an item, the new extended version overwrites the existing item in the container.

```php
use Joomla\DI\Container;

$container = new Container();

$container->set('foo', 'bar');

var_dump($container->get('foo')); // prints string(3) "bar"

$container->extend(
    'foo',
    function ($originalResult, Container $c)
    {
        return $originalResult . 'baz';
    }
);

var_dump($container->get('foo')); // prints string(6) "barbaz"
```

<!-- [x] Attempting to extend an undefined resource throws an InvalidArgumentException -->
If you try to extend an item that does not exist, an `\InvalidArgumentException` will be thrown.

<!-- [x] A protected resource can not be extended -->
> When extending an item, normal rules apply. A protected object cannot be overwritten, so you also can not extend them.

### Removing an Item

<!-- [x] Setting an object and then setting it again as null removes the object -->
Any resource can be removed from the container by assigning `null` to it.

```php
$container->set(
	'foo',
	function ()
	{
		return 'original';
	}
);
$container->get('foo'); // 'original'

$container->set('foo', null);
$container->get('foo'); // KeyNotFoundException
```

### Service Providers

Another strong feature of the Container is the ability register a _service provider_ to the container.
Service providers are useful in that they are a simple way to encapsulate setup logic for your objects.
In order to use create a service provider, you must implement the `Joomla\DI\ServiceProviderInterface`.
<!-- [x] When registering a service provider, its register() method is called with the container instance -->
The `ServiceProviderInterface` tells the container that your object has a `register` method that takes
the container as its only argument.

> Registering service providers is typically done very early in the application lifecycle. Usually
> right after the container is created.

```php
use Joomla\DI\Container;
use Joomla\DI\ServiceProviderInterface;
use Joomla\Database\DatabaseDriver;

class DatabaseServiceProvider implements ServiceProviderInterface
{
    public function register(Container $container)
    {
        $container->share(
            'Joomla\Database\DatabaseDriver',
            function (Container $c)
            {
                $databaseConfig = (array) $c->get('config')->get('database');

                return new DatabaseDriver($databaseConfig);
            },
            true
        );

        $container->alias('db', 'Joomla\Database\DatabaseDriver');
    }
}

$container = new Container();

$container->registerServiceProvider(new DatabaseServiceProvider);
```

Here is an alternative using a callable.

```php
use Joomla\DI\Container;
use Joomla\DI\ServiceProviderInterface;

class CallableServiceProvider implements ServiceProviderInterface
{
    public function getCallable(Container $c)
    {
        return 'something';
    }

    public function register(Container $c)
    {
        $c->set('callable', array($this, 'getCallable');
    }
}

$container = new Container();

$container->registerServiceProvider(new CallableServiceProvider);
```

The advantage here is that it is easier to write unit tests for the callable method (closures can be awkward to isolate
and test).

### Container Aware Objects

You are able to make objects _ContainerAware_ by implementing the `Joomla\DI\ContainerAwareInterface` in your
class. This can be useful when used within the construction level of your application. The construction
level is considered to be anything that is responsible for the creation of other objects. When using
the MVC pattern as recommended by Joomla, this can be at the application or controller level. Controllers
in Joomla are responsible for creating Models and Views, and linking them together. In this case, it would
be reasonable for the controllers to have access to the container in order to build these objects.

> __NOTE:__ The business layer of your app (eg: Models) should _never_ be container aware. Doing so will
> make your code harder to test, and is a far cry from best practices.

#### Container Aware Trait

Since PHP 5.4 [traits are available](http://www.php.net/traits), so you can use `ContainerAwareTrait`.
<!-- [x] Container can be set with setContainer() and retrieved with getContainer() -->
It implements the `setContainer` and `getContainer` methods.
<!-- [x] getContainer() throws an ContainerNotFoundException, if no container is set -->
If you try to retrieve a container that was not set before, a `ContainerNotFoundException` is thrown. 

Usage:

```php
use Joomla\DI\ContainerAwareInterface,
    Joomla\DI\ContainerAwareTrait,
    Joomla\Controller\AbstractController;

class MyConroller extends AbstractController implements ContainerAwareInterface
{
    use ContainerAwareTrait;
    
    public function execute()
    {
        $container = $this->getContainer();
    }
}
```
